### Introduction
---
I decided to try and create an APP that could pull the best photos from instagram, and place them in alligment, on a web-platform device. I wanted to find the best photos in all genres and have a refresh-rate short enough to display the latest and greated. Essentially becomming a go"to" place for the most popular content on instagram at that moment in time.

The idea for this when i watched one of my friends frantically refresh the "explore tabe on instagram (mobile App). This triggered my thought process, people -> see great new content -> often. While i thought that it could be possible to create a third-party mobile app for an app, i didnt see it as a affective solution. A web-based APP however, got my attention as i prefer to use instagram on their web-platform anyway.

STEP ONE 
---
My first step was verify the existence and version of the crucical programs that were going to power such idea. GIT and NODE.js 
To do so i simple opened my terminal and typed
```
Git --version
Node --version 
```
and it appeared i was out of date on both. Therefore i quickly updated both and carried onto my next step. I needed to be able to access libraries powerful enough to give me good javascript functionilty and integration with Instagram's API, and after copious research i discovered the delightful bower. 
```
npm -g install bower
```
Bower essentially is the back-bone to the APP.

###Hosting

To host my APP i looked at a few options, some local development servers etc.. i.e. Serve, rack, anvil..
But the easy and relatively cheap solution of Amazon Web Services (AWS) seemed to suit.
