Week 1 - Filter Bubbles

I was introduced to the concept of filter bubbles and how a filter bubble is a result of a personalized search in which a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the use, and, as a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. 
To much affect this started a process of reflection for me, allowing myself to isolate what my filter-bubbles were and understand the concept in its entirety. furthermore, develop ideas to how me and my group partner would pull valuable data for our application we would eventually develop.
Initial conversations started with what applications we each gravitated the most towards, and whether there was a generalised genre in topic of content appearing on their content-streams. For me personally, Sound cloud was a social network i frequented regularly to follow artists and keep updated on their content luscious profiles. Therefore i delved into

To develop an application that runs a filter bubble. A collection of artist’s music, still of a certain indie genre of music.
As a result of extensive research it appeared possible to become a sound cloud developer,  thus beginning to implement sound cloud streaming widgets. However, I felt we could of achieved higher, by building an application that really dived into the api of social network, and pull data that could see live results and push the boundaries of our coding barriers.
We looked at Twitter’s API, and immediately saw the potential within its ability to pull up-to-date live data, such as a “Tweeters message”, “location”, and “user ID”.
