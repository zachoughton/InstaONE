Week 3 - Filter Bubbles experiments

Throughout the Dynamic Web Unit, I am going to be documenting my experience learning jQuery and implementing API's into code. This process is taught in a term and will show different methods of how I learnt jQuery. I aim to show how i am progressing and expanding my knowledge of programming.
I have discussed my Learning goals for this unit. This lists three things in which I hope to achieve or understand throughout the process of this project.

Each Topic:

	•	Lecture 1: jQuery Recap style
	•	Lecture 1: Introduction to API's
	•	Lecture 2: Below the API Presentation was not present
	•	Lecture 3: Code Wars was not present 
	•	Lecture 4: jQuery Fundamentals Presentation was not present


jQuery Recap

In the primary Lecture, we were reintroduced to jQuery. Beforehand toward the end of the main level, we investigated utilizing jQuery and comprehended its usability. Over the late spring, a few of us tried different things with Javascript however as not everybody did, we went over the very nuts and bolts once more. 

This was great to show signs of improvement comprehension and clearer meaning of the components that are in jQuery. For instance, capacities and variables. 

We were indicated code and from this could play around with the very bare essentials.

Introduction to API’s

We additionally took a gander at what API's are and how they are utilized inside of sites and databases. I picked up a more noteworthy Understanding of conventions being an arrangement of traditions and thought how these could apply to API's. In class, we likewise took a look at specialized conventions that we discover on the web (e.g: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, DNS). 

To help us better comprehend API's, we were indicated how they are much the same as Interfaces. From the interface on your Gas Cooker, to your most loved App. Symbols are utilized to help you cooperate with something. Programming interface's are basically Interfaces to Program Applications.
