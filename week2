Week 2 - Peer Learning 


For peer learning, we were assigned the task of preparing a “mini-lesson” in small groups of 2/3 people to present to other classmates, 
effectively each group teaching the rest a topic under the general topic of API”s and their development using backend code-languages such as JAVAscript.
“For loops” was the topic i was assigned to develop on, and deliver a comprehensive explanation on. 
A challenge as this had been the first time i had researched into the basics of jQuery/Javascript.
